"Hello World". I am a Software Engineer and a Software Engineer Instructor for General Assembly. As an IT professional with 6+ years of experience I worked from client-side support to data analytics and server-side automation. I am passionate about coding and teaching. I love to be part of a student's development path; there is nothing like seeing and guiding them from their first "Hello world" app to a fully interactive and functional real-world application. These days you can find me busy developing automation solutions for server-side applications. In my spare time, I love to enjoy my beautiful family, play some video games or board games with them, and play some soccer on the weekends.
